What are React lifecycle methods?

You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.
Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events. I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.
Mounting – Birth of your component
Update – Growth of your component
Unmount – Death of your component
Now that we understand the series of lifecycle events let’s learn more about how they work.
